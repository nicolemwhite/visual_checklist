Reporting checklists provide expert guidance to researchers on how to transparently report details of their study. Summarising adherence to reporting checklists across multiple studies is a useful way to assess current trends in reporting, for example, as part of a literature review.

This Shiny application summarises assessments of individual studies against reporting checklists, based on data provided by the user. Results are summarised as figures and tables, which can be downloaded for use in reports or publications.

Full details are provided in the application vignette.
